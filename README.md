This project is a browser-based simple calculator, inspired by the Windows 10 calculator, with the following functionality:
- Basic math operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide) with left-to-right order of operation
- Some additional operators (percent-of, inverse, squared, square root)
- Stepwise display of calculation results
- Scrollable equation display for longer equations
- History functionality until page exit / reload
- Responsive calculator size / layout and dynamic font sizes
- Keyboard input support
- Light / dark mode

These are the skills learnt and/or demonstrated through this project:
- Combination of CSS grid, flexbox, and floats for positioning of elements, depending on what the element is used for (e.g. it is easier to create a custom scrollable element with floats)
- Use of both aspect ratio and size media queries for responsive sizing of the page in both axes, and to adjust base font sizes
- Working with objects and arrays with functions to enable calculation functionality
- Event listeners for the calculator buttons to work, and for container-dependent dynamic font sizes (e.g. if number input overflows the calculator display, or if container becomes too small on resizing window)
- Working with DOM data attributes for a simple implementation of history tracking for calculations
- Keyboard events for supporting keyboard input
